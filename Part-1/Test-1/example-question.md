# Create the following HTML document using raw javascript.

You will need to use javascript's DOM methods to re-create the following HTML document, such that, when 
Google Chrome's inspect element is used, the document layout is as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World</h1>
  <p>This is just a <strong>test message</strong></p>
  <button type="button">Click Me!</button>
</body>
</html>
